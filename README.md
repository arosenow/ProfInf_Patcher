# ProfInf_Patcher
Tool to help patch weidu mods that don't have globally unique labels necessary for Project Infinity

This is an R tool I made because many mods aren't supported by Project infinity and it's easier to add labels and fix 
them on the odd occasion the mod author has done something weird than to manually add a label after each Begin in a tp2 file
